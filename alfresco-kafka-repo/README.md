# Alfresco ACS JAR Module - SDK 4.1

This is an ACS project for Alfresco SDK 4.1.

Run with `./run.sh build_start` or `./run.bat build_start` and verify that it

 * Runs Alfresco Content Service (ACS)
 * (Optional) Runs Alfresco Share
 * Runs Alfresco Search Service (ASS)
 * Runs PostgreSQL database
 * Deploys the JAR assembled module
 * Runs Zookeeper
 * Runs Kafka
 
All the services of the project are now run as docker containers. The run script offers the next tasks:

 * `build_start`. Build the whole project, recreate the ACS docker image, start the dockerised environment composed by ACS, Share (optional), ASS 
 and PostgreSQL and tail the logs of all the containers.
 * `build_start_it_supported`. Build the whole project including dependencies required for IT execution, recreate the ACS docker image, start the dockerised environment 
 composed by ACS, Share (optional), ASS and PostgreSQL and tail the logs of all the containers.
 * `start`. Start the dockerised environment without building the project and tail the logs of all the containers.
 * `stop`. Stop the dockerised environment.
 * `purge`. Stop the dockerised container and delete all the persistent data (docker volumes).
 * `tail`. Tail the logs of all the containers.
 * `reload_acs`. Build the ACS module, recreate the ACS docker image and restart the ACS container.
 * `build_test`. Build the whole project, recreate the ACS docker image, start the dockerised environment, execute the integration tests and stop 
 the environment.
 * `test`. Execute the integration tests (the environment must be already started).
